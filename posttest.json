      "answers": {
        "a": "Density of the material of the rod",
        "b": "Young’s modulus of the material of the rod",
        "c": "Mass of the rod",
        "d": "Both density and Young's modulus of the material of the rod"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Partly correct, but not complete.",
        "b": "Partly correct, but not complete.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Speed is independent of total mass.",
