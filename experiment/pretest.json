      "explanations": {
        "a": "Sound waves are not transverse in gases; they are longitudinal.",
        "b": "Correct. In air and most media, sound waves are longitudinal.",

      "question": "For longitudinal waves, the particles in the medium",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Vibrate parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave",

        "a": "Correct. This is the defining characteristic of longitudinal waves.",
        "b": "This applies to transverse waves, not longitudinal.",
